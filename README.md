`geoops` does spatial operations on GeoJSON.

`geoops` is inspired by the JS library turf (http://turfjs.org/). It's
tagline is _Advanced geospatial analysis for browsers and node_.
Turf works only with GeoJSON, as does `geoops`. I don't know JS that well,
but it's easy enough to understand the language, so I've been porting
Turf to C++ wrapped up in R. The C++ so we can have fast performance. We've
also wrapped the Turf JS library itself in the package
lawn (https://github.com/ropensci/lawn), but we should be able to get better
performance out of C++.

`geoops` has a ways to go to include all the methods that Turf has, but
we'll get there eventually.

All data is expected to be in WGS-84.

We use a library from Niels Lohmann (https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
for working with JSON in C++.

## comparison to rgeos

FIXME!!! remove `rgeos` stuff as that pkg is gone

### distance


``` r
pt1 <- '{"type":"Feature","properties":{"marker-color":"#f00"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.343,39.984]}}'
pt2 <- '{"type":"Feature","properties":{"marker-color":"#0f0"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.534,39.123]}}'
library(rgeos)
rgeospt1 <- rgeos::readWKT("POINT(0.5 0.5)")
rgeospt2 <- rgeos::readWKT("POINT(2 2)")
```


``` r
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  rgeos = rgeos::gDistance(rgeospt1, rgeospt2),
  geoops = geoops::geo_distance(pt1, pt2, units = "miles"),
  times = 10000L
)
```

### nearest


``` r
point1 <- '{"type":["Feature"],"properties":{"marker-color":["#0f0"]},"geometry":{"type":["Point"],"coordinates":[28.9658,41.0101]}}'
point2 <- '{"type":["FeatureCollection"],"features":[{"type":"Feature","properties":{},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[28.9739,41.0111]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[28.9485,41.0242]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[28.9387,41.0133]}}]}'
points <- '{"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"type":"Feature","properties":{},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[28.9739,41.0111]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[28.9485,41.0242]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[28.9387,41.0133]}}]}'
g1 <- readWKT("MULTILINESTRING((34 54, 60 34), (0 10, 50 10, 100 50))")
g2 <- readWKT("POINT(100 30)")
```


``` r
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  rgeos = rgeos::gNearestPoints(g1, g2),
  geoops = geoops::geo_nearest(point1, points),
  times = 10000L
)
```

## Example use case

<details> <summary><strong>expand</strong></summary>

Get some GeoJSON data, a FeatureCollection of Polygons


``` r
file <- system.file("examples/zillow_or.geojson", package = "geoops")
x <- paste0(readLines(file), collapse = "")
```

Break each polygon into separate JSON string


``` r
library("jqr")
polys <- unclass(jq(x, ".features[]"))
```

Using `geo_area`, calculate the area of the polygon


``` r
areas <- vapply(polys, geo_area, 1, USE.NAMES = FALSE)
```

Visualize area of the polygons as a histogram


``` r
hist(areas, main = "")
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-13](man/figures/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)

Visualize some of the polygons, all of them


``` r
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles(provider = "OpenStreetMap.Mapnik") %>%
  addGeoJSON(geojson = x) %>%
  setView(lng = -123, lat = 45, zoom = 7)
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-14](man/figures/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)

Just one of them


``` r
leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles(provider = "OpenStreetMap.Mapnik") %>%
  addGeoJSON(geojson = polys[1]) %>%
  setView(lng = -122.7, lat = 45.48, zoom = 13)
```
