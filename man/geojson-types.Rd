\section{GeoJSON object}{


GeoJSON always consists of a single object. This object (referred to as the
GeoJSON object below) represents a geometry, feature, or collection of
features.

\itemize{
\item The GeoJSON object may have any number of members (name/value pairs).
\item The GeoJSON object must have a member with the name "type". This
member's value is a string that determines the type of the GeoJSON object.
\item The value of the type member must be one of: "Point", "MultiPoint",
"LineString", "MultiLineString", "Polygon", "MultiPolygon",
"GeometryCollection", "Feature", or "FeatureCollection". The case of the
type member values must be as shown here.
\item A GeoJSON object may have an optional "crs" member, the value of
which must be a coordinate reference system object (see 3. Coordinate
Reference System Objects).
\item A GeoJSON object may have a "bbox" member, the value of which must
be a bounding box array (see 4. Bounding Boxes).
